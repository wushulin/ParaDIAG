# ParaDIAG
ParaDIAG is a class of Parallel-in-Time (PinT) algorithms based on the diagonalization technique. ParaDIAG can handle both the dissipative problems (e.g., the advection-diffusion equations) and the purely wave equations (e.g., the acoustic equation)
We attached a PDF file, in which we introduce ParaDIAG with respect to basic ideas, necessary mathematics, illustrating Matlab results and some preliminary parallel results. The Matlab codes and the parallel codes (written by Fortran) are also provided.
