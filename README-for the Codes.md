We also provided some codes for testing the ParaDIAG algorthms. The Matlab Codes (in a document with name "Matlab Codes.zip") contains some 
simple codes for illustrating the basic idea of each ParaDIAG variant. We must state that the goal of these Matlab codes is to help the interested
reader understand the key features of the ParaDIAG algorithms and we have NO intention to make the codes  highly tuned for efficiency and/or
low memory use. 

The Parallel Codes (in a document with name "Parallel Codes.zip") contains the parallel codes in Fortran. The parallel results are obtained 
on China Tianhe-1 supercomputer, which is a multi-array, configurable and cooperative parallel system with a theoretical peak {performance} of 1.372 petaflops, composed
of high performance general-purpose microprocessors and a high-speed Infiniband network.
