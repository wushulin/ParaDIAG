# ParaDIAG
ParaDIAG is a class of Parallel-in-Time (PinT) algorithms based on the diagonalization technique. ParaDIAG can handle both the dissipative problems (e.g., the advection-diffusion equations) and the purely wave equations (e.g., the acoustic equation)
This is a brief Introduction of the ParaDIAG algorihtms, including the basic ideas, necessary mathematics, some illustrating numerical resutls based on Matlab and some preliminary parallel resutls.
