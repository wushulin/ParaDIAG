# ParaDIAG-version-1.0
ParaDIAG is a class of parallel-in-time (PinT) algorithms, which use the diagonalization of the concerned matrices as the basis. There are several variants of ParaDIAG and we prepare a note, namely "ParaDIAG_Version_1.0.pdf" to explain the baisc idea of each variant together with some crucial theoretical resutls. Compared with reading the full length published papers, we believe this can save much time and efforts for the interested reader. We will update the note when new materials are ready.  

It is entirely possible that the note has many glitches and we sincerely hope the reader can send us the finding. We welcome any interested reader to communicate with us for analysis, applicaitons, parallel testing and other aspects about ParaDIAG.
